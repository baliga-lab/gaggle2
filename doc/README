Gaggle 2 Infrastructure Project

Description:
------------

This project defines the successor to the Gaggle infrastructure system.

Goals:

  - integrate with web services in a browser- and platform-agnostic way
  - provide the user with a way to customize and configure personalized tool views
  - persistency for communication
  - preserve existing RMI communication mechanism to Java Desktop applications

Approaches:

  - a new Boss, written in Javascript
  - integration with Java Desktop applications is solved by a Java bridge applet,
    which sole purpose is to relay data from and to

Implementation technologies:

  - HTML/Javascript for visual and communication aspects
  - Java SE for the bridge
  - LiveConnect for data exchange between Javascript and Java

While Scala makes for a great alternative to implement the bridge, we use pure Java
instead. This decision ensures that we do only include 3rd party dependencies that
are absolutely necessary and can keep the bridge code archive relatively small.
