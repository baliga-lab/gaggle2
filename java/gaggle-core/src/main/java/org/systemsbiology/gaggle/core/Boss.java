/**
 * The core interface for the Gaggle Boss. Any software that wishes to coordinate
 * communication between one or more Gaggled applications (geese) must implement this.
 * Currently the Gaggle uses Java RMI for communication between Geese and the Boss.
 * Other (non-language-dependent) options are being considered.
 *
 * Implementations of Boss are desgined to be compiled by rmic into stubs which
 * can communicate across JVMs. Hence every method must throw RemoteException.
